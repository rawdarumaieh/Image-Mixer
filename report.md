#### this report includes some screen shots with the basic features of my program
#
# Result 1
* first i uploaded two images with the phase of the first and magnitude of the second
*the left output is the real component of image one with the imaginary component of image two both 50 % slider
*the right output is the phase component of image one with the magnitude component of image two both 50 % slider

#
# Result 2
* real image 1 and imaginary image 2
* the left output is image 1 real 18% and image 2 imaginary 0%
* the right output is image 2 unit magnitude 87% and image2 phase 100 %
